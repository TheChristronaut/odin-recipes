This project will be my first actual working website.

It will be a recipe website.
In this project I will be able to demonstrate my learned basic HTML skills.

Html at this point includes text consisting of paragraphs, headings, and lists. It also includes working links to other pages.

03/13/24 I added a CSS file and it included a few of the techniques I've learned to style the website. It still isn't pretty but I am showing progress.
