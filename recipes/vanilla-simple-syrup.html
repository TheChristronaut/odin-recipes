    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I hate when recipe websites contain an individuals entire life story before getting to the juice, the reason you are here, the recipe.</p>
    <p>Let's jump right in. This recipe is a simple easy recipe for a Vanilla Bean Simple Syrup, I love this in coffee and it's not too shabby in whiskey either, use case will vary by user.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>This is a simple recipe consisting of only 3 easy ingredients.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup Filtered Water</li>
        <li>1 cup Granulated Sugar. I use Sugar in the Raw, you can use your favorite or what you have on hand.</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Vanilla Bean Paste. You can use Vanilla Extract, but once you start using Vanilla Bean Paste you can't go back.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add water and sugar to medium sized saucepan over medium-high heat.</li>

        <li>Remove from heat and add Vanilla Bean Paste while mixture is still hot.</li>
        <li>Stir for about 30 seconds</li>
        <li>Transfer syrup into a glass container and let cool.</li>
        <li>Once cooled you can seal the container and refrigerate.</li>
