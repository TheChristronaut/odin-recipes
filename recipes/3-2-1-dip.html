        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I hate when recipe websites contain an individuals entire life story before getting to the juice, the reason you are here, the recipe.</p>
        <p>Let's get right to it. This is a recipe for a simple yet delicious dip for parties, gatherings or when you are home alone and sad.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>The ingredients here are simple, especially if you can count down from 3. That's where where this dip gets its name.</p>
        <div class="list">
            <ul>
                <li>3 (8 ounce) blocks Philadelphia Cream Cheese</li>
                <li>2 (10 ounce) cans Rotel</li>
                <li>1 pound Sausage</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You will have the best result with brand name Cream Cheese and Rotel and a higher quality sausage. Though you can save money buying generic, your dip will also be generic.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="list">
            <ol>
                <li>Prep Rotel by opening the cans, do not drain.</li>
                <li>Prep Cream Cheese by cutting it into about 1 inch blocks, this helps with melting.</li>
                <li>Brown 1 pound of Sausage in a large pan over medium-high heat, drain grease.</li>
                <li>Add 2 cans of Rotel into the pan with the sausage. Do not drain Rotel.</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to medium. Add 3 blocks of Cream Cheese cut into pieces in with the Rotel and Sausage.</li>
                <li>Stir frequently, until Cream Cheese is completely melted.</li>
                <li>Serve hot, best paired with tortilla chips.</li>
            </ol>
